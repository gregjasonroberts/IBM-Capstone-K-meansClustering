## Module 9 - Repository for IBM Capstone Project Notebook 

The consumer demand for child care, early education, and back-up care has grown in recent years in concert with the growing number of working family households.  Given many families continue to migrate within the suburbs of large metro areas, those cities offer proximity to work but has taxed the surrounding facilities with an adequate level of services for their children.  

## Business Problem:

A fast growing client has recognized the need to expand to other large metro areas and after internally reviewing the demographics with a segment of the largest cities in the country, have chosen Chicago and Washington, DC for the current review stage.  Due to the growing populations and high percentage of two-parent household working families, these cities were highlighted for closer inspection.  In particular, neighborhoods in these large hubs that shown a successful level of market penetration and competitor saturation. It is these neighborhoods that will reflect not only a substantial customer base to grow with, but a high likelihood of available labor as well.  

## Problem Statement:

The data science team will provide data and insight on the more desirable neighborhoods to target by implementing the following data sets and techniques:

- Part 1:  Data summarizing top 20 U.S. city demographics for labor population and household size.

##The U.S. Census Bureau datasets## were included using the Census.gov API.  These datasets were used to explore which cities were target rich environments for childcare services and warranted further inspection of surrounding neighborhoods.  The preliminary findings indicated that Chicago and Washington, DC satisfied our clients' requirements for a growing populous, both parents in the workforce with children below the age of 6.  Further review of the surrounding neighborhoods should yield areas with higher levels of competitor saturation indicating sufficient opportunity for growth and potential labor. 

- Part 2:  Neighborhood demographics that will indicate favorable environments for deployment.

After circling Chicago and DC for closer review, ##web scraping techniques## were employed to create datasets from the respective neighborhood on Wikipedia websites.   You can review the detail behind those datasets respectively for [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Chicago) and [Washington, DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_Washington,_D.C.)
